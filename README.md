 Today I also found that I needed to learn more JavaScript. 
 
 Been being taught on pluralsight is a little wasteful yet knowledgeful at the same time. 
 - not to be critical of the course however , 90% of the videos and teachings are 
 again helpful and are still however quite useful for introductions , but they generally go with 4 to 5 seperate videos around each individual task and then an entire video just only consisting of reviewing and looping the same confirmation of the video within the video , a few demos/ intros if one can keep up with anothers code on the details of syntax as well as on the fly  as such , 
 that factor can become encumbersome as such. So please,  let me be so kind as too give you a small demonstration and example of this exact construct to better serve us. It goes something like this ,
 
 - - - " Today we will be covering the material and educational courses that will be reviewed within this course."
- within this course you will find several objectives and references from the instructor in a detailed format as such and follows from the instructor. You will be learning and reviewing the following subjects. 

subject one , subject two and subject three , within each subject you owill also find a review item and within each item it will be reviewed that it has been reviewed as if that will somehow

- - - - as if 
- as if that be reassuring and confirming that one has in fact read the same thing someone said about something , that that is good enough for confirmation 
of learning . . . . 

now the brain numbing stuff. . . . mixed with poor reference points and undefined pre subjectory items that have not been covered is also one thing , 
but learning comes with the territory.

However within the 30 mins per subject about your intro and outro review homework ,, , , 

thats not even the issue , now let me tell you , 
let me tell you what i DESPISE about teachers on pluralsight , and its not even their fault 90%
of the time.
because they are super good and knowledgeable and helpful , but 

When they have no clue where someone left off,  BUT , 
- my class mentors are just awesome and thats where you will learn most of your nity grity. 

- But back to these pluralsight videos - - -  im not done with this diary entry. . . .

Back to these videos  (:p)
when the teach you in the 15 seconds that you catch a glimpse at the code it will be like , 


YOU SEE  how i defined this variable to an abject to an array to an object function array? 

let acrazyvariable = { [some array . some function. someobject[somevariableobjectarray] 
 color:blue
 display:flexbox
 ease-in:quantumvariableuxeffect +  Superman.function{acrazyvariable[ Entirelylargedataset].anothercrazyfunction}
}

Now what you do is yeah and click this and it works , there 
- now you know JavaScript , 
.....  back to what you have reviewed......   


and im still at like 

let intro = "I just want to see "
let intro2 = "How to name variables   "
let intro3 = ' into objects and arrays first WTH? and can I do an example somewhere geeze'
lex x = 5 

console.log(intro+intro2+intro3+ " I would like to know if my syntax is correct first please and thank you  " )

sheesh ... but what does let object =  function.(++let object=  ++function) mean? 

- thats what I thought  , with no intro or explination  ,how do you like it . . . . .? 




----- and thats why ...... Code House , 

because I want more links for myself too.
