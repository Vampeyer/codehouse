Welcome to the Code House

=========================================================================

When I joined code louisville , I went to work looking at different places to learn all the material at. 
Struggling and piecing all the things there is for a normal coding intro class , I spent much time honing in on the exact code I would need, and what it even did exactly.


But I was dissappointed to see that most of  the directions and resources directly on code louisvilles site, ends up all being up for 
lame old treehouse still. treehouse , are you serious?  
- in my opinion it seemed somewhat okay before , now its pay to learn about professional acting, - what a sham! 
Treehouse has became a rip off of face time to even bear too look at. At least they wont charge that to my bank hopefully...

BUT , I thought , How could one fix this? this is debilitating.

- Between these two issues , I immediately thought , well, If I am a web-developer now that could kind of 
solve the problem would it not? 


-- And then , Codehouse, 

Code house is a demonstration of what should be code louisvilles private knowledge base and reference repository. 
- first off , tree house was a application that I am trying to replace or more importantly do better than , 
secondly , this is an open-repository style repository that I would like to give to code louisville. 


This is supposed to be an example of a web dev 1  , knowledge based repo site , 
I hope it to be added onto where evedr needed , and hopefully we can create our own web dev 2 , 
data , 
Q & A , 
amd UX Design  / Code House designs that may be implemented into this , to further guide students and mentors alike through the numerous
resources within each perspective field. 


So,
Welcome , I hope you enjoy my site. 
This is a referencing site for developers , by developers , to help developers. 
this is essentially acting as a Q & A guideline , repo , and help database
 for all of what i see in the web dev 1 course. 
- More can be added for the entire code louisville code kentucky if we chose.


Now there are two things ,
1. I would like people to save and use my site , to help better the benefit of Code Louisville!!! 
2. i need someone else to take some time and add just a single web dev 2 page , and add onto it so that I can have 
juat a clear set guidelines of what to expect,  I have trouble keeping up with things , 
thats why i created this bush of a tree of websites. It doesnt have to be as cluttured , 
or as full or anything.  I was hoping the design of this could be used for all other code louisville 
projects like data / software engineering / web dev 2 ? 
and we could all learn from it and learn form each other so we dont have to repeat mistakes being stuck. 
Consider this , a web - based repository for educational links , and etc. 

But its ours this time... 

I hope we can all use it an all use it in as many other areas as possible. I hope the site 
helps you as much as it may help me!!!

feel free too add on , neatly edit , and whatever else really! 

- enjoy , Jake T.

This took me a whole lot of time to do myself , 
It will certainly be MUCH more easy and much more accessable after the students can have a clear review site.
