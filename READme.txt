Welcome to the Code House

=========================================================================

When I joined code louisville , I went to work looking at different places to learn all the material at. 
Struggling and piecing all the things there is for a normal coding intro class , I spent much time honing
 in on the exact code I would need, and what it even did exactly. 

THe course was less than par, so I created this website for reference. 

This website is intended for FOSS development, sourcing , and usage.
